# Spectrum
Global Game Jam 2017 game

The player is losing its spectrum of vision, but there is still hope. By collecting the spheres, they'd gradually gain their vision back color by color. However they must keep the wavelengths in range (by collecting the orbs) once they have all the different spectrums within the right wavelength range before the time ends they'd gain their sight back and see the so called beauty in this world (a lovely modeled cat)
